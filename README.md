leapdart
========

LeapDart is a work in progress of a Dart library for the Leap Motion device.
At the moment I'm porting the Leap.js javascript library to Dart as a starting point.
But the plan is to have it implemented in native Dart, using the best practices and tools available.

Collaborators are welcome! 
Join me on this endeavour!
